[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world's leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation.

In the Data Science Path Cumulative Project, we have partnered with the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/) and we were given a scrubbed dataset (800,000 rows) that describe user engagmeent with Twitch stream and Twitch chat on January 1st, 2015:

- [x] [`stream.csv`](stream.csv)

The `stream.csv` has the following fields:

`channel` | streamer name
